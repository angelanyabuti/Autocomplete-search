# Autocomplete-search
<p>This repository contains an implementation of an autocomplete feature created to demonstrate the Trie data structure. The application is built using Bootstrap for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It is designed to look up words from data stored in a database and provide real-time search suggestions.</p>
<p>The main goal of this project is to practice and refine skills in implementing the Trie data structure and integrating it with a full-stack application. This project showcases how to efficiently handle search suggestions and dynamically display relevant results.</p>
